Address ka type character hai.
(pointer reference) & operator exception -> does not print Address of type char.
To print address of char type use type casting.
For Reason say (<< operator) overload (Search why).

Pointer of diferent types  -> same size (as store address and add is same for all types (hexDec)).
Size of pointer -> 32 Bit system -> 4bit, 64 Bit system -> 8bit.

One type of pointer can not asign to other type. Reason -> data lose, different no of bits required to store data (as char require 1, and int requiure 4).
char *chprt = &x; ERROR -> can not convert int* to char*.
